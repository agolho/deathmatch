        <p><span class="dropcap">L</span>et’s kick some ass!" exclaimed Greg. The group chat was on fire. He had been streaming the some console multiplayer games for 2 hours. Now that his audience numbers surpassed 3 million mark, he could finally get on with it.</p><p>
  The Zero Repercussion Field, ZRF for short was the hot new thing in gaming. After the VR flop of 2010’s, gaming hardware manufacturers needed something with a punch to innovate with. After the breakthrough developments in the area of physics and the following paradigm shifts in society, it was possible to teleport to short distances. This changed everything. Transportation, lifestyle, wars… They were never going to be the same. All said and done, life on earth never seemed so different. The Superior Teleportation Company, the guys who hold the patent on teleportation and almost a monopoly on it, wanted to branch out and with some game developers they invented the ZRF. At first the games were bland remakes of the games of the real world, players went to another player’s place to join chess, checkers and other board games. But it was a hit nonetheless. Then Superior published their first, most anticipated competitive multiplayer game, The Deathmatch. With the help of the medical industry and their patent on teleportation they had managed to make a snapshot of the player’s body and could revert back any damage they may have inflicted upon. It was revolutionary, the military was definitely in on it, forums sprawled with conspiracy theories.</p><p>
  The Deathmatch was a runaway hit, the other multiplayer games saw a significant drop on their playerbases after its release. But the ZRF wasn’t cheap and had a 160km radius, so it continued to be novel and niche even for its success. Greg remembered his first play in the Deathmatch. He just got the thing and set it up anxiously in his recreation room. After synchronising his ID with the device, he joined a room in the list. In a flash the empty room say for Greg and the device, filled with all sorts of melee weapons and a body armour with a helmet. He had 5 minutes to get ready. He put on the simple carbon body armour and picked up a cricket bat. He took his position and was standing guard, then the 30 seconds countdown started. When it hit zero he was in somewhere else. A young woman was standing in one corner. The game randomised the teleport locations in the room so she had no way to know where he would materialise. But unlucky for Greg she was more experienced than himself. She had a helmet and a digital camo body armour and a meter long orange pipe wrench. Before he could adjust himself she swung the pipe wrench directly into his neck. It was excruciating. His neckbones shattered into thousand pieces and one of the bone shrapnels cut his artery. He fell down and the world silently faded to black. Then he woke up in the floor of his room. He quickly checked his neck. Nothing. He was fine. He might have peed a little but other than that he was perfectly okay. “This...is...awesome” he screamed.</p><p>
  After his first encounter he quickly joined another. This time it was his turn to host to room. When the countdown started he crouched in a corner and patiently waited under a thin blanket. A guy in his forties appeared in his rec room. Surprised to see it empty he cautiously scanned the room again. Greg was waiting for him to turn his back and when he did Greg jumped out of his corner and smacked one with his bat in the guys left ankle. The man lost his balance and fell down facing up. Greg put his boot on his right hand and removed the man's helmet.  He bashed the man’s skull so hard that a piece of his brain stuck in the ceiling. ZRF detected that the man had no pulse and teleported him back. After his dematerialisation even the blood on Greg’s face disappeared. The room was squeaky clean. </p><p>
  The game removes all the objects it provides with the disconnect from the server. Some players get attached to their 8” pipes and their baseball bats and want to buy them permanently or want something with more of a flair, like World war 1 era trench batons. Superior sold these kinds of things in their online store for a significant money. But all the forum posts claimed they well worth the money. Greg came across these kinds of special weapons from time to time. One time an Asian lady killed him with a blunt lightsaber, he couldn’t get the bright red neon glow in the room out of his head. But he wouldn’t get something that obnoxious, it wouldn’t fit his stealthy style.</p><p>
  After some time he figured he could make some money on the side with streaming the game. He bought a helmet with an action camera which wirelessly transferred the video stream to the game server then back to his streaming app. For the games that took place in his room, he set up an array of cameras into the walls of his rec room. For this reason he preferred to fight in his place. There was some options to fight in some virtual environments in the game, like the International Space Station or the Chernobyl’s 4th reactor. But those places gave him the creeps. Sure he liked to fight in the bridge of USS Enterprise occasionally but they got old pretty quickly.
