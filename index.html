        <p><span class="dropcap">L</span>et’s kick ass!" exclaimed Greg. The group chat was on fire. People all over from the world cheering and wondering what he had in store for tonight. He had been streaming console multiplayer games for 2 hours. Now that his audience numbers surpassed 3 million mark, he could get on with it.</p><p>
          The Zero Repercussion Field, ZRF for short was the hot new thing in gaming. Some time after the VR flop of 2010s, gaming hardware manufacturers needed something with a punch to innovate with, after the breakthrough developments in physics and the following paradigm shifts in society, it was possible to teleport to short distances. This changed everything. Transportation, lifestyle, wars… They would never be the same. All said and done, life on earth never seemed so different. The Superior Teleportation Company, the guys who hold the patent on teleportation and almost a monopoly on it, wanted to branch out and with game developers they invented the ZRF. At first the games were bland remakes of the games of the real world, players went to another player’s place to join chess, checkers and other board games. Despite that, it was a hit. Then Superior published their first, most anticipated competitive multiplayer game, The Deathmatch. With the help of the medical industry and their patent on teleportation they can make a snapshot of the player’s body and could revert any damage they may have inflicted upon. It was revolutionary, the military was definitely in on it, forums sprawled with conspiracy theories. </p><p>
        The Deathmatch was a runaway hit, the other multiplayer games saw a significant drop on their player bases after its release. But the ZRF wasn’t cheap and had a 160km radius, so it continued to be novel and niche even for its success. Greg remembered his first play in the Deathmatch. He got the thing and set it up in his recreation room. After synchronizing his ID with the device, he joined a room in the list. In a flash the empty room say for Greg and the device, filled with all sorts of melee weapons and a body armour with a helmet. He had 5 minutes to get ready. Excitedly put on the simple carbon body armour and picked up a cricket bat and took his position and was standing guard, then the 30 seconds countdown started. The countdown hit zero he was in somewhere else. A young woman was standing in one corner. The game randomised the teleport locations in the room, so she had no way to know where he would materialise. But unlucky for Greg she was more experienced than himself. She had a helmet and a digital camo body armour and a meter long orange pipe wrench. Before he could adjust himself she swung the pipe wrench into his neck. It was excruciating. His neck bones shattered into a thousand pieces and one of the bone shrapnel cut his artery. Greg fell down, and the world faded to black. Then woke up in the floor of his room and checked his neck. Nothing. He was fine, he might have peed a little but other than that he was okay. “This… is… awesome” he screamed.</p><p>
        He joined another deathmatch and this time it was his turn to host to room. When the countdown started he crouched in a corner and waited under a thin blanket. A guy in his forties appeared in his rec room. Surprised to see it empty he scanned the room again. Greg was waiting for him to turn his back and when he did Greg jumped out of his corner and smacked one with his bat in the guys left ankle. The man lost his balance and fell facing up and Greg put his boot on his right hand and removed the man's helmet.  He bashed the man’s skull so hard that a piece of his brain stuck in the ceiling. ZRF detected that the man had no pulse and teleported him back, and after his dematerialisation even the blood on Greg’s face disappeared. The room was squeaky clean. </p><p>
        The game removes all the objects it provides with the disconnection from the server. Not a few players get attached to their 8 inch pipes and their baseball bats and want to buy them or want something with more of a flair, like World War 1 era trench batons. Superior sold these kinds of things in their online store for significant money. But all the forum posts claimed they well worth the money. Greg came across these kinds of special weapons from time to time. One time an Asian lady killed him with a blunt lightsaber, he couldn’t get the bright red neon glow in the room out of his head. But he wouldn’t get something that obnoxious, it wouldn’t fit his stealthy style.</p><p>
        Greg realized that he could make money on the side with streaming the game. He bought a helmet with an action camera which transferred the video stream to the game server then back to his streaming app. For the games that took place in his room, he set up an array of cameras into the walls of his rec room.  He preferred to fight in his place. There were options to fight in virtual environments in the game, like the International Space Station or the Chernobyl’s 4th reactor. But those places gave him the creeps. Sure he liked to fight in the bridge of USS Enterprise, but they got old fast.
